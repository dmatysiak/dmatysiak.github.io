\title{What is a computer?}

\p{In common speech, the word "computer" signifies a physical device used for
computation. Typically, the meaning is even more narrow than that, referring specifically
to electronic computing devices, and even more specifically such electronic devices as
personal desktop or notebook computers. Naturally, the full range of electronic devices
that can qualify as "computing devices" is much broader than what popular intuition might
admit, and it is here that our problems begins. Where do we draw the line between a
computing device and something else as a matter of objective fact? If you try to approach
the problem from a physical perspective, you will find it difficult to find this line. You
may find yourself reaching for definitions like the [Church-Turing
thesis](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/church-turing/) to try to justify your
claim. This latter tactic is progress—we are drawing on a foundational notion of the field
to justify our claim—but it is also unsatisfactory, because the susbtance of the
Church-Turing thesis depends on a presupposed notion of \em{computation}.}
