\title{What is an artifact?}

\p{The world is composed of a plurality of objects, coming into and going out of being,
that exist in a variety of relations to one another. \em{What} an object is—a horse, a
human being, a rock, an automobile—is central to its identity \em{as} the kind of thing
that it is. This \em{whatness} of thing goes by a number of names: nature, form, essence,
etc. It is that which causes a thing to be the kind of things it is. For that reason, it
often goes by the name of \em{formal cause} to distinguish from the other kinds of causes,
viz., \em{efficient cause}, \em{material cause} and \em{final cause}.}

\p{However, even where the form of a thing is concerned, there are further distinctions to
be made. The most important distinction is that of \em{substantial form} and
\em{accidental form}. Substantial form is the cause of \em{substance}, a thing with
independent existence—that which has properties and attributes, but which is not a
property or attribute of something else. The components of a substance are causally
intrinsically ordered. The paradigmatic example is the living organism. An example might
be a tree. The leaves of a tree are not something tacked onto the tree or incidental to a
tree. They are an integral part of the tree, when the tree grows them. They are inherently
ordered, both structurally and functionally, toward the fulfillment of the ends of the
tree. The ends of a tree are intrinsinc to the tree itself. It has an inherent tendency to
be and function the way it does.}

\p{Compare substantial form with \em{accidental form}, where the cause of unity is
incidental, involving relations between components that are incidental to the composite or
any of the subtances in the composite. Tables, automobiles, sculptures and computers are
all examples. Nothing in the things themselves makes necessary the shape or arrangement
they are in. In the case of an automobile, engineers imposed an accidental form onto a
collections of objects, arranging them in a certain way so that these objects interact in
ways that further the ends of the human user. The ends of such a thing are extrinsic to
the thing itself. It have no inherent tendencies to do or be what it is.}

\p{Whether the identity of at thing is intrinsic to a thing or extrinsic has significant
and far-reaching consequences, one of which is what can be said to be objectively true
about the structure and function of the object.}
