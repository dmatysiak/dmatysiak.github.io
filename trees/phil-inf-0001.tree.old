\title{The proper object of computer science}

\p{There is a [famous
quote](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2021/04/02/computer-science/)—often attributed to
Edsger Dijkstra, but predating the earliest records of him having made this claim—that
computer science is not about computers, any more than astronomy is about telescopes, or
biology about microscopes. I fully agree with this claim, but nonetheless, it has proved
to be controversial for some. I believe the controversy is rooted in a misunderstanding of
what a computer is and what computation is. We can clarify these concepts with the help of
the history of the field as well as some metaphysical analysis. Once we have done do, the
distinctions between computer science, software engineering and computer engineering will
follow naturally.}
