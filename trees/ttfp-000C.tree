\title{Absurdity}

\p{Absurdity (#{\bot}), otherwise known as contradiction or the false proposition, does not have an introduction rule, though it can be inferred from a proposition like #{A \land \neg A}. But it can be eliminated, because anything follows from contradiction (\em{ex falso quodlibet}):

##{\frac{\bot}
       {A}(\mathtt{\bot E})}}
