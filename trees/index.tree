\p{My name is [[danielamatysiak]]. This collection of notes is primarily meant to function as a repository of notes for my own reference, and secondarily or incidentally for anyone who is interested. I don't know how diligently this repository will be maintained. I generally prefer to maintain handwritten notes first, and so for the most part, any notes here will be dervied from my handwritten notes.}
