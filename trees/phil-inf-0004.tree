\title{What is an artifact?}

\p{The world is composed of a plurality of objects, coming into and going out of being,
that exist in a variety of relations to one another. \em{What} an object is—a horse, a
human being, a rock, an automobile—is central to its identity \em{as} the kind of thing
that it is. This \em{whatness} of thing goes by a number of names: nature, form, essence,
etc. It is that which causes a thing to be the kind of things it is. For that reason, it
often goes by the name of \em{formal cause} to distinguish from the other kinds of causes
like \em{efficient cause}.}
