\title{Conjunction rules}

\p{The \em{conjunction introduction rule} builds a composite derivation by combining derivations of the conjuncts into a derivation of the conjunction:

##{\frac{\begin{array}{lr}A & B\end{array}}
        {A \land B}(\mathtt{\land I})}}

\p{The \em{elimination rules for conjunction} allows us to derive the constituent conjuncts from an existing conjunction:

##{\frac{A \land B}
        {A}(\mathtt{\land E_A})}

##{\frac{A \land B}
        {B}(\mathtt{\land E_B})}}
